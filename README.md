This project uses react, react-router-dom, nes-css and some CSS animations to create a pokemon-style microsite, used for our baby announcement.

This project was bootstrapped using [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), follow the instructions there to get started in booting up the app. Alternatively, check it out on the live announcement site - [loading.mckirgan.com](https://loading.mckirgan.com).
